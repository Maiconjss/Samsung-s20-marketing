# Get Your Book


## Project's goal :

It is a very simple project where the objective was to carry out a small interaction with the user, the customer clicking a button automatically appears a small form (containing its proper styling). After the click, other functionalities arise, such as filling in the information and required and an action to send this data in order to have its due return.

A very simple example was used with the DOM manipulation, where the 'click' adds a new class that contains the form and when clicking again it removes, cleaning the user's screen.

### Before the click:

## Javascript:

`document.querySelector ('header button') .addEventListener (" click ", function () {document.querySelector ('. form') .classList.toggle ('hide')})` j

## Comments :

At the end of this experiment, I concluded that through a few elements we can make the user experience more pleasant, a characteristic that for me is extremely important for front-end development.
